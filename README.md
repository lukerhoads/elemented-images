# Elemented Images

<img src="https://ibb.co/5rsFF7J" />

Hey! This is a project I started to give everyone the ability to generate clean cover images. Sometimes, it just sucks to open illustrator and make these tedious things. 

Through making this, I have learned a lot about cloud functions/api gateways. At first, I thought that I would have to protect my cloud funciton through an API gateway, but one of my dearest friends told me that I could just rate limit through an npm library. 

# Some things that could always be added:
<ul>
  <li>Redis queueing</li>
  <li>Smarter options/better image library/integrations</li>
<ul>

Hey! This is a project I started to give everyone the ability to generate clean cover images. Sometimes, it just sucks to open illustrator and make these tedious things. 

```/functions```
This is the cloud functions folder which was deployed to firebase.

```/src```
React project here.

```Assets```
Building block images.

Through making this, I have learned a lot about cloud functions/api gateways. At first, I thought that I would have to protect my cloud funciton through an API gateway, but one of my dearest friends told me that I could just rate limit through an npm library.
